## 🗂️ Project Structure

```bash
src/
├── components/
│   └── MovieSearch.jsx
├── App.jsx
├── index.css
└── main.jsx
```

## 💡 How It Works

- MovieSearch.jsx contains the main input field and logic.

- Movie cards animate on scroll using Framer Motion, providing a modern, interactive feel.

- CSS classes are added using the className attribute.

- All styles are written in App.css and applied globally.
