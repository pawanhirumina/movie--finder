# 🎬 Movie Search App

A simple React application that allows users to search for movies using a text input. The app is styled with a global `index.css` file and demonstrates basic React component structure and CSS styling.

## 🚀 Features

- 🔍 Search bar for finding movies
- 💡 React component-based structure
- 🎨 Global styling with `App.css`
- ⚡️ Built using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) for fast development and build times

## 🗂️ Project Structure
```bash
src/
├── components/
│ └── MovieSearch.jsx
├── App.jsx
├── index.css
└── main.jsx
```



## 💡 How It Works

- `MovieSearch.jsx` contains the main input field.
- CSS classes are added using the `className` attribute.
- All styles are written in `App.css` and applied globally.
